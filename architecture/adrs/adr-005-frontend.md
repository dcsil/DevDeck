## ADR 005: Frontend Framework — React

### Context

We need a frontend framework to build an interactive user interface for our application. The framework should support rapid development, reusable components, and a strong ecosystem of libraries. Developer familiarity and community support are important as well since the team needs to deliver quickly for the MVP.

### Options

**React**: Component-based, widely adopted, strong ecosystem, large community, good support for integrations and testing tools. All the team members are familiar with React.

**Angular**: Full-featured framework with built-in state management, routing, and dependency injection. Steeper learning curve and more opinionated structure.

**Vue.js**: Lightweight and beginner-friendly, good documentation, but smaller ecosystem compared to React and Angular.

### Decision

We chose React for the frontend. It provides the best balance of flexibility, ecosystem support, and developer familiarity, which is critical for rapid iteration during the MVP phase. Most importantly, all the team members are familiar with React.

### Status

Accepted — React will be our frontend framework for MVP and beyond.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

1. Large ecosystem of libraries, UI kits, and developer tools.

2. Strong community support and documentation.

3. Enables fast iteration with reusable components.

**Negative / Risks:**

1. Potential complexity in managing app state at scale.

**Future pivots:**

1. If a smaller footprint UI is needed, we may consider Vue.js.
