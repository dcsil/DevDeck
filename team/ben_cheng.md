## About Ben

Ben Cheng is a fourth-year Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of Toronto, maintaining a 3.92 GPA. Over the past year, he worked as a 5G ML Software Developer at Ericsson, applying reinforcement learning algorithms such as DQN and PPO to optimize real-time wireless scheduling. He also worked on system integration in C++ and automated performance monitoring with InfluxDB and Grafana. In addition, he has contributed to the Centre for Social Services Engineering by developing a GraphDB-powered semantic search engine and to the Middleware Systems Research Group by building a robust database and web system. His research experience spans diffusion-based image generation using multi-GPU training with PyTorch and Accelerate, and LSTM-based time-series analysis.

## Strengths

- Strong ability to manage and prioritize multiple tasks effectively
- Proficient across a wide range of commonly used technologies, including frontend, backend, and machine learning  
- Skilled in debugging and resourceful in finding solutions to complex problems

## Weaknesses

- Sometimes lose track of earlier design decisions or ideas if not documented well
- Tend to learn best through personal trial and error, and still improving at leveraging others’ experiences directly
- Can find it challenging at times to maintain a healthy work–life balance when deeply engaged in projects
