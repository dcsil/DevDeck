Team Principles
---

The team principles doc is a roughly 1-page document that covers expectations of the team members, expectations for communication, roles and responsibilities, work delegation, etc. The document will cover the entire team, including CSC454/2527 students.  
Optionally, team values can also be described.

Communication
---

Our team will use a dedicated **Discord server** for all communications.  
- This server will serve as the central hub for discussions, meetings, assignment coordination, and task tracking.  
- Each member is expected to check messages **at least once per day (Monday‚ÄìFriday)**. If someone cannot be available for more than a day, they must notify the group in advance.  
- When asking a question, members should tag specific people if they need a response; otherwise, post it to the group channel.  
- Important questions and answers should be acknowledged with quick reactions (üëç/üëé) to show they have been seen.  
- **Absences**: If a member cannot attend a discussion or meeting, they should inform the team as early as possible and provide a brief update on their work so others can step in if needed.  
- For emergencies, we will keep a list of phone numbers pinned in a private channel for urgent contact (text or call only if necessary).  

Meetings
---

- We will hold **weekly team meetings on Discord** to review progress and plan upcoming work.  
- All members are expected to attend. If someone cannot attend, they must notify the group in advance and either:  
  - Share an update beforehand, or  
  - Ask another teammate to deliver their update during the meeting.  
- Members who miss a meeting are responsible for **catching up on notes and decisions** and clarifying their new tasks.  
- Meetings should be recorded, or transcripts/notes should be kept, to track past decisions.  

Work
---

- Work will be delegated fairly during meetings and tracked using **GitHub Issues**.  
- All contributions must be made via **Pull Requests** with reviews from other members.  
- Members should complete work with enough time left for reviews and discussion; **last-minute submissions are discouraged**.  
- If a task becomes too difficult or time-consuming, members should raise the issue in advance so others can help.  
- We value mutual support ‚Äî no one is expected to solve problems alone.  

Other Issues
---

- **Decision-Making**: For major decisions, we will discuss as a group. If consensus cannot be reached, the team leader will make the final call.  
- **Conflict Resolution**: Disagreements should be handled respectfully. We will address conflicts directly within the group before escalating.  
- **Accountability**: Each member is responsible for their commitments. Repeated missed deadlines without communication will be addressed by the team.  
- **Flexibility**: We understand that unexpected situations may arise. As long as members communicate openly, the team will adapt and redistribute tasks as needed.  

Team Values
---

- **Quality & Impact**: We care about delivering work that is not only complete but also meaningful and well thought out.  
- **Collaboration**: We believe the best results come from working together, supporting one another, and sharing knowledge openly.  
- **Continuous Learning**: We stay curious and embrace opportunities to learn new skills, technologies, and perspectives to grow as a team.
