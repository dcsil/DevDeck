Team Principles
---

This document outlines the principles that guide how our team works together throughout the course. Its purpose is to set clear expectations for communication, collaboration, and accountability, ensuring that all members are aligned. These principles are not meant to be rigid rules, but rather a shared agreement that helps us stay organized, respectful, and effective as a team.  

By defining our approach to communication, meetings, work delegation, and conflict resolution, we aim to create an environment where everyone feels supported, responsibilities are clear, and contributions are valued. This document will evolve as our team grows, and we will revisit it regularly to adapt to new challenges and lessons learned.  

Communication
---

Our team will use a dedicated **Discord server** for all communications.  
- This server will serve as the central hub for discussions, meetings, assignment coordination, and task tracking.  
- Each member is expected to check messages **at least once per day (Monday‚ÄìFriday)**. If someone cannot be available for more than a day, they must notify the group in advance.  
- When asking a question, members should tag specific people if they need a response; otherwise, post it to the group channel.  
- Important questions and answers should be acknowledged with quick reactions (üëç/üëé) to show they have been seen.  
- **Absences**: If a member cannot attend a discussion or meeting, they should inform the team as early as possible and provide a brief update on their work so others can step in if needed.  
- For emergencies, we will keep a list of phone numbers pinned in a private channel for urgent contact (text or call only if necessary).  

Meetings
---

- We will hold **weekly team meetings on Discord** to review progress and plan upcoming work.  
- All members are expected to attend. If someone cannot attend, they must notify the group in advance and either:  
  - Share an update beforehand, or  
  - Ask another teammate to deliver their update during the meeting.  
- Members who miss a meeting are responsible for **catching up on notes and decisions** and clarifying their new tasks.  
- Meetings should be recorded, or transcripts/notes should be kept, to track past decisions.  

Work
---

- Work will be delegated fairly during meetings and tracked using **GitHub Issues**.  
- All contributions must be made via **Pull Requests** with reviews from other members.  
- Members should complete work with enough time left for reviews and discussion; **last-minute submissions are discouraged**.  
- If a task becomes too difficult or time-consuming, members should raise the issue in advance so others can help.  
- We value mutual support ‚Äî no one is expected to solve problems alone.  

Other Issues
---

- **Decision-Making**: For major decisions, we will discuss as a group. If consensus cannot be reached, the team leader will make the final call.  
- **Conflict Resolution**: Disagreements should be handled respectfully. We will address conflicts directly within the group before escalating.  
- **Accountability**: Each member is responsible for their commitments. Repeated missed deadlines without communication will be addressed by the team.  
- **Flexibility**: We understand that unexpected situations may arise. As long as members communicate openly, the team will adapt and redistribute tasks as needed.  

Team Values
---

- **Quality & Impact**: We care about delivering work that is not only complete but also meaningful and well thought out.  
- **Collaboration**: We believe the best results come from working together, supporting one another, and sharing knowledge openly.  
- **Continuous Learning**: We stay curious and embrace opportunities to learn new skills, technologies, and perspectives to grow as a team.
