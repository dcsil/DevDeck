Diversity
---

Diversity is one of the defining strengths of our team. Even though we are all Computer Science students at the University of Toronto, our academic paths, professional experiences, and personal interests differ in meaningful ways. These differences allow us to bring together unique perspectives that enrich our collaboration and help us design a solution that addresses the real challenges faced by early-stage teams. In this document, we highlight how our diverse backgrounds contribute to our work, identify areas where we lack expertise, and discuss how we plan to close those gaps through subject matter experts and external feedback.


Team Background & Team Strength
---

Our team is composed of four members: Ben Cheng, Brenden Yiping Wang, Chen Jiang, and Zihao (Leon) Wang. Each member contributes not only technical expertise but also unique working styles and personal qualities that strengthen the team.

Ben has worked as a 5G Machine Learning Software Developer at Ericsson, where he applied reinforcement learning to optimize real-time scheduling. His strength lies in analyzing complex systems and applying machine learning to prediction and optimization problems. This background is directly relevant to our solution, as it equips him to design models for forecasting timelines, detecting risks, and ensuring schedules remain realistic. 

Brenden is currently a Full Stack Developer at Chatsimple, where he integrates AI agents, builds cloud-based applications, and works on real-time voice AI. His ability to communicate technical concepts clearly makes him a natural bridge between technical and business discussions. Within our project, his expertise supports AI-driven task decomposition, dependency mapping, and dynamic re-scheduling. His collaborative approach makes him an effective contributor in both technical and strategic roles.

Chen brings experience from a 12-month internship at Roadpost, where she focused on full-stack development, AWS infrastructure, and workflow automation with Temporal. She is highly organized and detail-oriented, making her well-suited for coordination, product planning, and ensuring our solution remains aligned with real startup needs. Her quick learning ability and broad technical foundation strengthen our adaptability.

Leon, who interned as a backend developer at VirgoCX, specializes in Java, Spring Boot, and databases. He contributes backend expertise and ensures the reliability of our core system architecture. His collaborative mindset makes him dependable, and his experiences with backend systems allow him to design services that are both scalable and efficient.

Together, these strengths create a foundation of technical robustness, adaptability, and creativity. Our diverse experiences across telecommunications, fintech, AI startups, and cloud services give us perspectives that extend beyond academics and prepare us to handle the cross-functional challenges embedded in our problem space.

## Weaknesses

Despite our combined strengths, our team acknowledges areas where diversity is lacking. From a technical standpoint, we are well covered in backend systems, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure, but we have limited exposure to fields such as business strategy, financial modeling, and large-scale startup operations. These gaps may limit our ability to fully understand market positioning, fundraising strategies, or legal constraints that real startups must navigate.

On a personal level, some of us are introverted or detail-focused, which can make it difficult to move quickly in uncertain environments. Others sometimes struggle to maintain work–life balance or to make decisions rapidly. These tendencies could become weaknesses under startup-like pressure, where speed, adaptability, and outward-facing communication are critical. By recognizing these patterns early, we aim to mitigate them through open communication and shared accountability.

### Subject Matter Experts

To compensate for areas where our team lacks expertise, we plan to seek input from subject matter experts. Mentors with experience in entrepreneurship and business strategy can help us validate market assumptions and refine our approach to customer segments. AI and machine learning specialists, particularly those working on project management applications, can provide feedback on how to best integrate predictive models into planning workflows. Finally, advisors with product management or marketing experience can guide us in making our solution accessible not just to developers but also to sales, marketing, and operations teams.

## Limited Diversity

Our team size and composition also limit our diversity. All four of us come from the same Computer Science program at the University of Toronto, which means we share similar academic training and technical perspectives. While this provides us with strong alignment on software development, it also narrows our exposure to other disciplines such as business, design, and marketing. These areas are often critical for early-stage teams, where non-technical founders, product managers, or marketers bring perspectives that shape how projects are prioritized and communicated. Without such viewpoints directly represented in our team, we may risk designing a solution that is overly technical and less attentive to broader organizational or customer needs. To address this limitation, we plan to actively engage with people outside our discipline—through user interviews, mentor feedback, and collaboration with individuals who represent business and design functions—to ensure that our solution reflects the realities of diverse startup teams and avoids blind spots caused by our shared background.

### How this can impact us

Lack of diversity in perspectives can lead to bias in product design, missed opportunities, and poor market alignment. By acknowledging where we fall short and actively seeking input from subject matter experts and diverse customer groups, we aim to avoid these pitfalls. At the same time, we will continue to build on our strengths, our varied technical expertise, adaptability, and collaborative culture to ensure that our solution addresses the real pain points of early-stage teams. While we cannot eliminate every blind spot, we are committed to building inclusivity and awareness into both our team culture and our product development process.
