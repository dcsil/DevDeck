Diversity
---

Diversity allows us to bring together different perspectives, experiences, and skills. By combining technical expertise with cultural and academic variety, we are able to approach challenges from multiple angles and create more thoughtful, inclusive, and impactful solutions.

Team Background
---

Our team comes from a variety of cultural and academic backgrounds. We represent multiple continents and speak several languages, which gives us a global perspective when working on projects. We have strong foundations in software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning, while members with skills in design, product thinking, and communication ensure the solutions remain user-centric and impactful.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

Our team has several strengths:
- Strong technical foundation in full-stack development, cloud platforms, and modern frameworks, ensuring technical robustness  
- Quick adaptability and eagerness to learn new technologies  
- Effective collaboration with clear communication across different time zones and cultural backgrounds  
- Creative problem-solving and innovative thinking  

At the same time, we acknowledge some weaknesses:
- Limited prior experience working as a team before this course  
- Possible challenges in coordinating schedules across different commitments  
- Less exposure to business/marketing compared to technical areas  

### Subject Matter Experts

Subject matter experts (SMEs) who can help us address our expertise gaps are:
- Team members with experience in AWS infrastructure and DevOps to support deployment and scalability decisions  
- Members familiar with machine learning and AI tools to help integrate intelligent features  
- Those with a design and product focus to improve user experience and presentation  
- External SMEs, such as instructors, mentors, or industry contacts, when needed  

## Diversity

Our team has a varied background in nationality, language, academic fields, and professional experience. However, we acknowledge that we do not have people experienced in areas including:
- Business strategy and market analysis  
- Legal or financial expertise  
- Large-scale startup or entrepreneurship experience  

### How this can impact us

A potential impact of this is that the absence of these perspectives might limit our ability to fully anticipate non-technical challenges, such as go-to-market strategy or regulatory considerations.  

People with backgrounds that differ from our own — especially in business, design, and industry-specific domains — can help us better position our solution in the real world and make our project more impactful.
